Description: 
    RBSA provides tools for robust sensitivity analysis and hypothesis testing in observational studies. 
    It incorporates advanced statistical methods, such as gamma sensitivity tests and quadratic programming, 
    to rigorously evaluate the impact of treatment effects while accounting for unobserved confounding. 
    The package supports flexible machine learning models for propensity score estimation, 
    including Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and SVM, enabling comprehensive 
    and customizable analyses for matched study designs.
