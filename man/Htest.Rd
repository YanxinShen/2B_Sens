\arguments{
\item{d1}{Data frame for the first group. It must contain the following variables:
\itemize{
\item \code{q}: Numeric vector, outcome variable for the group.
\item \code{phat}: Numeric vector, predicted probabilities or propensity scores for the group.
\item \code{Z}: Numeric vector (0 or 1), treatment assignment (1 = treated, 0 = control).
\item \code{index}: Numeric vector, grouping index for matched individuals.
\item \code{upper}: Numeric vector, upper bounds for decision variables.
\item \code{lower}: Numeric vector, lower bounds for decision variables.
}}

\item{d2}{Data frame for the second group. It has the same structure as \code{d1}.}

\item{F0.1}{Integer (default is 0), gamma test result for the first group.
Set to 1 if the first group hypothesis was already rejected in a prior step.}

\item{F0.2}{Integer (default is 0), gamma test result for the second group.
Set to 1 if the second group hypothesis was already rejected in a prior step.}

\item{alpha1}{Numeric (default is 0.0125), significance level for the main hypothesis testing step.}

\item{alpha2}{Numeric (default is NA), significance level for sensitivity analysis.
If \code{conv_test = TRUE}, \code{alpha2} is not used.}

\item{rank}{Logical (default is \code{FALSE}), whether to apply a rank transformation to \code{q}.}

\item{test_beta}{Numeric (default is 0), value to adjust the observed treatment effect.}

\item{gamma}{Numeric, sensitivity parameter representing the degree of departure from random assignment.}

\item{conv_test}{Logical (default is \code{TRUE}), whether to perform a conventional sensitivity analysis.
If \code{FALSE}, quadratic constraints are added for advanced sensitivity testing.}

\item{params}{List of additional parameters for the Gurobi optimization solver.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{bigH} - Combined hypothesis result for both groups (0 = accept null hypothesis, 1 = reject null hypothesis).
\item \code{H0.1} - Hypothesis result for the first group.
\item \code{H0.2} - Hypothesis result for the second group.
\item \code{obj.1} - Objective value for the first group.
\item \code{obj.2} - Objective value for the second group.

\description{
This function conducts hypothesis testing for sensitivity analysis in observational studies.
It evaluates the null hypothesis (\code{H0}) for both treated and control groups by solving
quadratic programming problems with constraints.
}
\details{
The function performs hypothesis testing for two groups (\code{d1} and \code{d2}).
It constructs quadratic coefficient matrices and linear terms using helper functions
(\code{get_Q} and \code{get_w}). Constraints are built using \code{constr}, and
optimization is performed with the Gurobi solver. The function can optionally apply
advanced sensitivity testing by incorporating quadratic constraints (\code{quadcon}).

The testing procedure involves:
\itemize{
\item Constructing and solving a quadratic programming problem for each group.
\item Evaluating the hypothesis result (\code{H0}) based on the solver's output.
\item Combining the results (\code{H0.1}, \code{H0.2}) into a final decision (\code{bigH}).

\examples{
# Example usage of the maintest function

# Load a preprocessed dataset (replace 'sample_data' with your actual data object)
data(sample_data)

# Extract variables from the dataset
treated_lst <- sample_data$treated_lst
control_lst <- sample_data$control_lst
Z <- sample_data$dataset$Z  # Treatment assignment
X <- sample_data$dataset$X  # Covariates
R <- sample_data$dataset$R  # Outcome variable

# Preprocess
dts = preprocess(treated_lst, control_lst, Z, X, R)
d1 = dts[[1]]
d2 = dts[[2]]

# Set parameters for hypothesis testing
F0.1 <- 0  # Gamma test result for the first group
F0.2 <- 0  # Gamma test result for the second group
alpha1 <- 0.0125  # Significance level for the first stage
alpha2 <- 0.025   # Significance level for the second stage
rank <- FALSE     # Whether to use rank transformation
test_beta <- 0    # Adjust observed treatment effect
gamma <- 4        # Sensitivity parameter
conv_test <- FALSE # Use main test
params <- list(TimeLimit = 1000)  # Gurobi solver parameters

# Perform hypothesis testing
result <- Htest(

# View the result
print(result)

# Interpretation:
# - `bigH`: Combined hypothesis result for both groups (0 = accept, 1 = reject).
# - `H0.1` and `H0.2`: Hypothesis results for the first and second groups.
# - `obj.1` and `obj.2`: Objective values for the first and second groups.
